                    <p>Xaltam technologies provides an integrated and continuously updated view of core business processes using common databases maintained by a database management system. Our systems track business resources—cash, raw materials, production capacity—and the status of business commitments: orders, purchase orders, and payroll. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, accounting, etc.) that provide the data. ERP facilitates information flow between all business functions and manages connections to outside stakeholders.ERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes—consulting, customization, and support.</p>
